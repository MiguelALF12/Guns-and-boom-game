# Guns-and-boom-game

This is the game me and my partner Juan Camilo Salazar developed for our university class Graphic computing.

It is a platformer, fight-based, two-player game. There are four different characters, two maps and two perks that will appear during the game.

The game consist on the two player with an initial life, and every time one of the player gets hit the life will decrease. The first to kill the other wins.

## set-up instructions

- Clone the repository or download the zip
- Open up your terminal or IDE of preference (in case you want to detail the code)
- Type `python3 main.py`
